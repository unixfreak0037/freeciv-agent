# Freeciv Agent

I'm playing around with the idea of an agent that can play the game of freeciv as another player. Doing a few things with this project.

- Testing how well an LLM can write software with guidance from me.
- Building a Python library that can be used to connect to a freeciv server.
- Learning how to use langchain and langgraph.
